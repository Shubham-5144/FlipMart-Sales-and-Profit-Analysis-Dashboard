## Dashboard Features and Insights
1. Sales by Region

2. Profit by Category
•	Technology accounts for 51% of profits, making it the most profitable category.
•	Office Supplies (43%) and Furniture (6%) follow.
•	Furniture has the lowest profit margin despite significant sales—this may require cost optimization or pricing adjustments.

•	Corporate (31%) and Home Office (19%) segments follow.
•	This highlights that Consumer-focused strategies could yield higher returns.
5. Sales & Profit by Subcategory
•	Top-performing subcategories include:
•	Phones ($0.33M in profit)
•	Binders ($0.20M in profit)
•	Low-performing subcategories like Tables ($0.21M in sales) might need reevaluation for profitability.
6. Shipping Mode Analysis
•	The majority of orders are shipped via Standard Class (59%), followed by Second Class (20%).
•	Same Day shipping accounts for only 6%, suggesting potential for premium delivery services.
7. Profit & Sales by State

•	Specific states contributing most to profits can be identified for targeted campaigns.

## Recommendations
1.	Expand Marketing in Underperforming Regions:
Focus on the South region to increase its contribution to overall sales.
2.	Optimize Furniture Category:
Investigate high costs or low margins in the Furniture category to improve profitability.
3.	Leverage Holiday Season Trends:
Prepare targeted campaigns for Q4 to maximize December sales spikes.
4.	Promote Consumer Segment:
Develop loyalty programs or discounts aimed at the Consumer segment to further boost sales.
5.	Enhance Shipping Options:
Introduce incentives for faster delivery options like Same Day shipping to attract premium customers.

## Conclusion
The Flipmart dashboard effectively highlights key trends in sales, profit, and customer behavior through interactive visualizations. By addressing low-performing categories and regions while leveraging strengths like Technology products and Consumer segments, Flipmart can achieve sustainable growth in future periods.
